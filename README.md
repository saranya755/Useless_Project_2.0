### Project Description
Digital Goldfish is a virtual pet that lives in its own world. It occasionally tells you how it feels (‚ÄúI‚Äôm hungry‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm full‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sleepy‚Äù). You can't chat with it, but you can feed it.
If you don‚Äôt feed it in time, it will die.
If you feed it too much, it gets annoyed ‚Äî but won‚Äôt stop you.
That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs emotionally distant and fragile. Just like a real goldfish.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
 ‚ÄúWhat if your digital pet had needs, but didn‚Äôt care whether you cared?‚Äù


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We made a digital fish with feelings (sort of).
It:
Monologues about its own hunger
Can‚Äôt hear you
Has a single ‚ÄúFeed‚Äù button
Dies if neglected
Talks about dying before it does
> Example: ‚ÄúI'm starving... I see a light... never mind, it was a bubble.‚Äù
